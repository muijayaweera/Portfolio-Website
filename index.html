            <p>OstoCare is a mobile application designed to improve the lives of ostomy patients by providing them with ongoing care, emotional support, and easy access to vital information. The app helps patients track their health, locate nearby hospitals and pharmacies, connect with stoma care nurses, and even record their progress. It was developed as part of a university project, aiming to tackle a real-world healthcare challenge in Sri Lanka.</p>
            <p>The app is built using Flutter for cross-platform compatibility, with Firebase serving as the backend for real-time data storage and authentication. Its development followed the Agile methodology, ensuring iterative progress and adaptability throughout the project.</p>
            <p>What makes OstoCare special is its dual focus: while it empowers patients with tools for daily care and emotional well-being, it also supports healthcare providers with access to patient data and teleconsultation features. It’s more than just an app—it’s a step towards bridging healthcare gaps for a vulnerable community.</p>

            <h2>IoT-Based Smart Shelf</h2>
            <p>The IoT-Based Smart Shelf is an innovative system developed as a university project to help businesses track stock levels and item movements in real-time. It combines hardware and software to monitor inventory automatically, reducing human errors and improving efficiency in retail and warehouse management.</p>
            <p>The system uses Arduino, ESP32, load cells, RFID tags with a reader, and LCD displays to detect product weight, identify items, and display stock information. On the software side, I built a web dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, connected to Firebase for real-time data visualization through bar and pie charts.</p>
            <p>A unique point about this project is how it integrates multiple devices into one ecosystem. It not only displays stock levels and low-stock warnings but also identifies fast-moving and slow-moving items, giving businesses better insights into their inventory. It demonstrates the practical use of IoT in solving everyday business challenges.</p>
